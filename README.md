# MOLB Agency Portal Backend

This document lists the steps to get this up and running.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11
- Gradle

To run the supporting services, you need:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

#### Configure your IDEA

- Import code style
    - Open IDEA, enter `Preferences -> Editor -> Code Style -> Import Schema`
    - Choose `config/GoogleStyle.xml`
      > This style is based on GoogleStyle and default Kotlin style of Intellij Team, is suitable for both Java and Kotlin.

- New line end of file
    - Enter `Preferences -> Editor -> General`
    - Check on `Other: Ensure line feed at file end on Save`
    - For newer versions of IntelliJ, Check on `Save Files: Ensure every saved file ends with a line break`

- Set jvm of gradle
    - Enter `Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle`
    - Select `Gradle JVM: Use Project JDK`
  > If the jvm is different with your project, will cause 'No tests found' error

### Lint

If you are using InteliJ for backend development. Please follow the steps to configure code format rule of the IDE.
